# Duncan's Shitty Streaming Software

If you're anything like me, you've often thought "Sure, streaming seems cool, but I want to stream know the creator of the software put less time and effort into making it than I did installing it"
Well fear not, because now you can!
In a mear 15 lines of code you too can stream to you're own browser (you will need to make more to stream to anyone else).
Requirements
  - Python
  - pyscreenshot
Running
  - Run stream.py with python
  - open the index file in your browser
  - enjoy
